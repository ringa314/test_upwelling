## 2. Functions and Subroutines
* __add_taylordiag.m__

  Function used by __fig1_O2Ar_hist_map_yearly.m__ and __fig2_NCP_yr_map.m__ to adjust _NCP_ values to a
  self-designed color scale and then mapped by the RGB data in __cmap_NCP.mat__
  
* __info_params.m__
  
  Information used by all the MATLAB scripts __*.m__ to specify parameters used for creating figures
